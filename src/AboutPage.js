      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Little Lemon, a restaurant that brings the taste of traditional Brooklyn pizza and burgers to your table. Our recipes have been passed down for generations and are made with the freshest ingredients. But that's not all - we also have some intriguing historical ties to the Mob, dating back to the days when Brooklyn was the epicenter of organized crime. Legend has it that some of our original recipes were created by a renowned mobster's wife, who cooked up a storm in her kitchen and shared her secret recipes with only the most trusted members of the community. Today, we continue to honor our roots by serving up some of the best pizza and burgers in town, with a dash of history and a whole lot of flavor. Come dine with us and experience a little taste of Brooklyn's past and present.</p>
